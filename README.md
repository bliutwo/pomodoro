# Pomodoro Python script

Small python scripts designed to help with productivity.

Uses Python 2. TODO: Eventually will use Python 3.

Usage: 

```
python custom_pomodoro.py
```

- Requires pygame. http://askubuntu.com/questions/399824/how-to-install-pygame

- [Installing pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) (this only installs pygame for Python 3)

TODO:

- [ ] Add a separate thread for playing the sound

- [ ] Make a Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android executable/app
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Mac
  - [ ] Linux
  - [ ] Android

- [ ] Account for breaks and global timer in determining #pomodori & percentage

- [ ] Include functionality for smarter "break" times (e.g. if 3 hours, 6 pomodori, break after 3 instead of 4) <-- probably completely optional/unoptimal
